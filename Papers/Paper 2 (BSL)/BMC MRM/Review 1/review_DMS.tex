\section*{Review of ``Estimated Covid-19 burden in Spain: ARCH underreported non-stationary time series''}
% General intro text goes here

% Let's start point-by-point with Reviewer 1
\reviewersection

We thank the reviewer for their critical reading of our work and their comments and suggestions, responded below.

% Point one description 
\begin{point}
Title, abstract, keywords weren't fitted together. The main approach ARCH wasn't interested within abstract in methods paragraph, while in title and keywords appear as main proposed approach.
	\label{pt:C1}
\end{point}

\begin{reply}
Following the reviewer's suggestion, the \textit{Methods} paragraph in the abstract has been updated to:

\textcolor{blue}{``\textit{\textbf{Methods:}} In this work, we explore the performance of Bayesian Synthetic Likelihood to estimate the parameters of a model based on AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedastic time series capable of dealing with misreported information and to reconstruct the most likely evolution of the phenomenon. The performance of the proposed methodology is evaluated through a comprehensive simulation study and illustrated by reconstructing the weekly Covid-19 incidence in each Spanish Autonomous Community.''}

The \textit{keywords} have also been updated, replacing GARCH to ARCH, which is the main proposed approach as pointed out by the reviewer.
\end{reply}

\begin{point}
The problems and objectives don't mentioned clearly in abstract.
	\label{pt:C2}
\end{point}

\begin{reply}
To clarify, the \textit{Background} paragraph of the abstract has been rewritten to:

\textcolor{blue}{``\textit{\textbf{Background:}}The problem of dealing with misreported data is very common in a wide range of contexts for different reasons. The current situation caused by the Covid-19 worldwide pandemic is a clear example, where the data provided by official sources were not always reliable due to data collection issues and to the high proportion of asymptomatic cases. In this work, a flexible framework is proposed, with the objective of quantifying the severity of misreporting in a time series and reconstructing the most likely evolution of the process.''}

\end{reply}

\begin{point}
``Estimation'' is not fitted with time series, while ``Forecasting'' or ``prediction'' is more appropriate.
	\label{pt:C3}
\end{point}

\begin{reply}
We agree with the reviewer that ``estimation'' is usually referred to parameters and ``prediction'' is usually used in relation to values of the series. We have carefully reviewed the manuscript and changed the wording accordingly.
\end{reply}

\begin{point}
The measurements of error should be used such as MAPE, RMSE, ans others.
	\label{pt:C4}
\end{point}

\begin{reply}
Although the main objective of this work is not in forecasting future values but in reconstructing the most likely values of the hidden process, error measures like those proposed by the reviewer can also be computed by taking the registered values as reference. Therefore, following the reviewer's suggestion, the following paragraph has been added to the manuscript (page 13):

\textcolor{blue}{``The registered values predicted by the model can also be obtained as $\hat{Y_t} = (1-\hat{\omega}+\hat{\omega} \cdot \hat{q}) \cdot \hat{X_t}$, and compared to the actual registered values $Y_t$. That allows computing standard forecasting error measures as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) or Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Overall, the RMSE was 113,145.4 and MAPE was around 8\%, ranging between 4 to 13\% across regions. The RMSE and MAPE for each region are described in Table S1 in the Supplementary Material.''}

Additionally, the table with specific RMSE and MAPE for each Spanish region has been added as Table S1 in the Supplementary Material.

\end{reply}

\begin{point}
Discussions and conclusions should include more details about ARCH and its results.
	\label{pt:C5}
\end{point}

\begin{reply}
Following the reviewer's suggestion, the following paragraph has been added to the \textbf{Discussion} section:

\textcolor{blue}{``Using a flexible approach for the underlying hidden process, such as ARCH time series, are a natural extension to recent developments (see for instance [19]) proposed for fitting underreported time series but restricted to the case when the underlying process has an ARMA structure and allow us to model phenomena presenting more complex behavior like Covid-19 in the long time period considered in the present work.''}

\begin{point}
Good manuscript but the statistics in paper were beyond my expertise to comment.

We thank the reviewer for their critical reading of our work and their positive comment.

% Let's start point-by-point with Reviewer 3
\reviewersection

% Point one description 
\begin{point}
In this paper, the authors employ a method to deal with underreported data and apply it to a dataset of COVID-19 cases in Spain. Although the method is of interest, the authors are not providing new methodological tools, but only applying existing ones. Besides, I have the following specific comments:
	\label{pt:C9}
\end{point}

\begin{reply}
We thank the reviewer for their critical reading of our work and their comments and suggestions, responded below.
\end{reply}

\begin{point}
The simulation study carried out by the authors is not motivated enough, in my opinion. The method has already been tested by their authors, so why performing this  simulation study?
	\label{pt:C10}
\end{point}

\begin{reply}
The method used to estimate the parameters of the model (Bayesian synthetic likelihood) is known and well-tested, but to the best of our knowledge it has never been used in the context of AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (ARCH) underreported models, and this is why its performance is assessed through the simulation study. To clarify, the following paragraph has been added to the manuscript (page 5):

\textcolor{blue}{``Although the estimation method is already known and has been tested before, to the best of our knowledge it has never been used in the context of ARCH time series, and therefore a thorough simulation study has been conducted...''}

\end{reply}

\begin{point}
In Figures 1 and 2 I feel that something is wrong with the plot. For instance, in Figure 2, I don't understand the values around 2022-01. Maybe the upper estimation for that time point is greater than the maximum value fixed for the y-axis?
	\label{pt:C11}
\end{point}

\begin{reply}
As the reviewer points out, there is something curious about the values around 2022-01. The question is that in all simulations these particular values are detected as not being underreported ($Y_t = X_t$), maybe due to the breakout of a new variant with different characteristics around these dates. This is why the estimated and registered values and the 95\% credible interval for this value are all equal, as represented in Figure 1 and Figure 2. To clarify, the following sentences has been added to the manuscript (page 13):

\textcolor{blue}{``As can be seen in Figure 1 and Figure 2, there are 4 weeks (2021-12-26, 2022-01-02, 2022-01-09 and 2022-01-16) for which the predicted values coincide with those registered in all simulations, so no underreporting is detected these weeks. This behavior might be due to the breakout of a new variant with different characteristics (for instance producing more symptomatic cases and therefore reducing the underreporting) around these dates.''}

\end{reply}

\begin{point}
I also feel that there might be some inconsistency between the results highlighted in page 18 and those provided in Table 2 (estimates of q for Aragon and Extremadura).
	\label{pt:C12}
\end{point}

\begin{reply}
We thank the reviewer for noticing these inconsistencies between the estimates provided in the text and in Table 2. We detected an issue in the reported estimates for these two regions and we ran the analyses again (also for the other regions, but not differences were found). All reported values have been carefully revised and corrected when necessary, including the Figures and the reported results. 
\end{reply}

\begin{point}
In the Conclusions, there are some comments referred to the covariates included in the model. I would consider moving these results from the Supplementary Material to the main text.
	\label{pt:C13}
\end{point}

\begin{reply}
Following the reviewer's suggestion, the estimates corresponding to the impact of the considered covariates have been included in the main text (Table 2) and removed from the Supplementary Material.
