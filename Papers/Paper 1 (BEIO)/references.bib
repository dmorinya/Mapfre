This is a Hidden Markov Model whose hidden layer is a regeneration process with Poisson immigration, Po-INAR(1), together with a mechanism that allows the estimation of the under-reporting in non-stationary count time series. A novelty of the model is that the expectation of the unobserved process’s innovations is a time-dependent function defined in such a way that information about the spread of an epidemic, as modelled through a Susceptible-Infectious-Removed dynamical system, is incorporated into the model. In addition, the parameter controlling the intensity of the under-reporting is also made to vary with time to adjust to possible seasonality or trend in the data. Maximum likelihood methods are used to estimate the parameters of the model.},

	abstract = {COVID-19 caused significant disruption to cancer services around the world. The health system in Aotearoa New Zealand has fared better than many other regions, with the country being successful, so far, in avoiding sustained community transmission. However, there was a significant initial disruption to services across the cancer continuum, resulting in a decrease in the number of new diagnoses of cancer in March and April 2020. Te Aho o Te Kahu, Aotearoa New Zealand's national Cancer Control Agency, coordinated a nationwide response to minimise the impact of COVID-19 on people with cancer. The response, outlined in this paper, included rapid clinical governance, a strong equity focus, development of national clinical guidance, utilising new ways of delivering care, identifying and addressing systems issues and close monitoring and reporting of the impact on cancer services. Diagnostic procedures and new cancer registrations increased in the months following the national lockdown, and the cumulative number of cancer registrations in 2020 surpassed the number of registrations in 2019 by the end of September. Cancer treatment services - surgery, medical oncology, radiation oncology and haematology - continued during the national COVID-19 lockdown in March and April 2020 and continued to be delivered at pre-COVID-19 volumes in the months since. We are cautiously optimistic that, in general, the COVID-19 pandemic does not appear to have increased inequities in cancer diagnosis and treatment for Māori in Aotearoa New Zealand.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Our objective was to assess the effects of COVID-19 antiepidemic measures and subsequent changes in the function of the health care system on the number of newly diagnosed breast cancers in the Republic of Croatia.
SUBJECTS, MATERIALS, AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective, population- and registry-based study during 2020. The comparator was the number of patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer during 2017, 2018, and 2019. The outcome was the change in number of newly diagnosed breast cancer cases.
RESULTS: The average monthly percent change after the initial lockdown measures were introduced was -11.0\% (95\% confidence interval - 22.0\% to 1.5\%), resulting in a 24\% reduction of the newly diagnosed breast cancer cases in Croatia during April, May, and June compared with the same period of 2019. However, during 2020, only 1\% fewer new cases were detected than in 2019, or 6\% fewer than what would be expected based on the linear trend during 2017-2019.
CONCLUSION: It seems that national health care system measures for controlling the spread of COVID-19 had a detrimental effect on the number of newly diagnosed breast cancer cases in Croatia during the first lockdown. As it is not plausible to expect an epidemiological change to occur at the same time, this may result in later diagnosis, later initiation of treatment, and less favorable outcomes in the future. However, the effect weakened after the first lockdown and COVID-19 control measures were relaxed, and it has not reoccurred during the second COVID-19 wave. Although the COVID-19 lockdown affected the number of newly diagnosed breast cancers, the oncology health care system has shown resilience and compensated for these effects by the end of 2020.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: It is possible to compensate for the adverse effects of COVID-19 pandemic control measures on breast cancer diagnosis relatively promptly, and it is of crucial importance to do it as soon as possible. Moreover, as shown by this study's results on the number of newly diagnosed breast cancer cases during the second wave of the pandemic, these adverse effects are preventable to a non-negligible extent.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to a policy of severe restrictions in almost all countries strongly involved by the pandemic. National Health System is among activities suffering from the COVID-19 and the lockdown.
AIM: To evaluate the impact of COVID-19 in colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention.
METHODS: We report the change in the hospital organization to meet the growing healthcare needs determined by COVID-19. The limitations of CRC prevention secondary to COVID-19 and their effects on the healthcare are analyzed considering the features of the CRC screening programs in the average-risk population and endoscopic surveillance in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD).
RESULTS: The interruption of CRC prevention may lead to a delayed diagnosis of CRC, possibly in a more advanced stage. The economic burden and the impact on workload for gastroenterologists, surgeons, and oncologists will be greater as long as the CRC prevention remains suspended. To respond to the increased demand for colonoscopy once COVID-19 will be under control, we should optimize the resources. It will be necessary to stratify the CRC risk and reach an order of priority. It should be implemented the number of health workers, equipment, and spaces dedicated to performing colonoscopy for screening purpose and in subjects with alarm symptoms in the shortest time. To this aim, the funds earmarked for healthcare should be increased.
CONCLUSION: The economic impact will be dramatic, but COVID-19 is the demonstration that healthcare has to be the primary goal of humans.},

The period “after lockdown” included the lockdown phase (March 22 to May 31, 2020) and unlock phase (June 1 to November 5, 2020). Mothers delivered during this period in the study area were interviewed using semi-structured questionnaires. In-depth interviews (IDIs) were conducted in a subsample to understand the experiences, challenges, and factors for underutilization of healthcare services.FindingsThe survey covered a total population of 21,025 in 4,762 households; 199 eligible mothers (mean age 27.4 years) were interviewed. In women who delivered after lockdown against before lockdown, adjusted odds of having {\textgreater}2 antenatal care visits in the third trimester was 80\% lower (aOR 0.2, 95\% CI 0.1–0.5); proportion of institutional deliveries was lower (93 vs. 97\%); exclusive breastfeeding during first 6 months of birth (64.5 vs. 75.7\%) and health worker home visitation within 6 weeks of birth (median, 1 vs. 3 visits) were substantially lower. Fear of contracting COVID-19, poor quality of services, lack of transportation and financial constraints were key issues faced by mothers in accessing health care. More than three-fourth (81\%) of the mothers reported feeling down, depressed or hopeless after lockdown. The major factors for stress during lockdown was financial reasons (70\%), followed by health-related concerns.ConclusionCOVID-19 pandemic-related lockdown substantially affected maternal and perinatal healthcare utilization and service delivery.},

	abstract = {Objective The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic had a major impact on healthcare utilisation. The aim of this retrospective review was to quantify how utilisation of non-COVID care changed during this time so as to gain insight and inform planning of future services during potential second and subsequent waves.
Methods and analysis A longitudinal design was used to analyse anonymous private UK health insurer datasets covering the period of January 2018 to August 2020. Taken as a measure of healthcare utilisation in the UK, incidence rates of claims broken down by service area and condition were calculated alongside overall monthly totals and costs. Pre-COVID-19 years were compared with the current year.
Results Healthcare utilisation during the first wave of COVID-19 decreased by as much as 70\% immediately after lockdown measures were implemented. After 2 months, the trend reversed and claims steadily began to increase, but did not reach rates seen from previous years by the end of August 2020. Assessment by service and diagnostic category showed that most areas, especially those highly reliant on in-person treatment, reflected the same pattern (ie, rapid drop followed by a steady recovery). The provision of mental health services differed from this observed trend, where utilisation increased by 20\% during the first wave of COVID-19, in comparison to pre-COVID-19 years. The utilisation of maternity services and the treatment of existing cancers also stayed stable, or increased slightly, during this time.
Conclusions Healthcare utilisation in a UK-based privately insured population decreased dramatically during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, being over 70\% lower at its height. However, mental health services remained resilient during this time, possibly due to greater virtualisation of diagnostics and care.},

	abstract = {Objectives To determine the extent and nature of changes in utilisation of healthcare services during COVID-19 pandemic.
Design Systematic review.
Eligibility Eligible studies compared utilisation of services during COVID-19 pandemic to at least one comparable period in prior years. Services included visits, admissions, diagnostics and therapeutics. Studies were excluded if from single centres or studied only patients with COVID-19.
Data sources PubMed, Embase, Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and preprints were searched, without language restrictions, until 10 August, using detailed searches with key concepts including COVID-19, health services and impact.
Data analysis Risk of bias was assessed by adapting the Risk of Bias in Non-randomised Studies of Interventions tool, and a Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care tool. Results were analysed using descriptive statistics, graphical figures and narrative synthesis.
Outcome measures Primary outcome was change in service utilisation between prepandemic and pandemic periods. Secondary outcome was the change in proportions of users of healthcare services with milder or more severe illness (eg, triage scores).
Results 3097 unique references were identified, and 81 studies across 20 countries included, reporting on {\textgreater}11 million services prepandemic and 6.9 million during pandemic. For the primary outcome, there were 143 estimates of changes, with a median 37\% reduction in services overall (IQR −51\% to −20\%), comprising median reductions for visits of 42\% (−53\% to −32\%), admissions 28\% (−40\% to −17\%), diagnostics 31\% (−53\% to −24\%) and for therapeutics 30\% (−57\% to −19\%). Among 35 studies reporting secondary outcomes, there were 60 estimates, with 27 (45\%) reporting larger reductions in utilisation among people with a milder spectrum of illness, and 33 (55\%) reporting no difference.
Conclusions Healthcare utilisation decreased by about a third during the pandemic, with considerable variation, and with greater reductions among people with less severe illness. While addressing unmet need remains a priority, studies of health impacts of reductions may help health systems reduce unnecessary care in the postpandemic recovery.

	abstract = {Background and aims
COVID-19 has impacted healthcare system worldwide including cancer case. Aim of this study was to describe the experience of lockdown on cancer care concerning patient's visit and reception of treatment in western India.

Methods
This is a retrospective observational study conducted in patients with cancer attending a tertiary care center pre-lockdown and during lockdown (from January to May 2020). Data related to demographic parameters, type of tumor, type of treatment received and functional status of patients were retrieved from hospital medical records of patients.

Results
Of the 5258 patients included, 4363 visited hospital pre-lockdown (median age, 50 years) and 895 visited during the lockdown period (median age, 47 years). A total of 1168 and 106 patients visiting hospital before and during lockdown, respectively, had comorbidities. Breast cancer (25.6\% and 29.7\%), head and neck cancer (21.3\% and 16.9\%) were the most common type of solid tumors; leukemia (58.0\% and 73.0\%), lymphoma (18.8\% and 13.5\%) and multiple myeloma (18.6\% and 12.2\%) were the most common type of hematological malignancies observed in patients visiting pre-lockdown and during lockdown, respectively. Chemotherapy was most commonly received treatment (pre-lockdown, 71.8\%; during lockdown, 45.9\%). Other therapies reported includes supportive/palliative, targeted, hormonal, and immunotherapy. The majority of patients who visited the hospital pre-lockdown (68.4\%) and during lockdown (62.8\%) had 0 or 1 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score.

Conclusion
Overall observations highlight a substantial impact of an imposed nationwide lockdown during COVID-19 pandemic on cancer care of patients in terms of reduced patient visits and number of treatments received.},
