	volume = {26},

	shorttitle = {{COVID}-19 {Pandemic} {Effects} on {Breast} {Cancer} {Diagnosis} in {Croatia}},
	doi = {10.1002/onco.13791},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Our objective was to assess the effects of COVID-19 antiepidemic measures and subsequent changes in the function of the health care system on the number of newly diagnosed breast cancers in the Republic of Croatia.
SUBJECTS, MATERIALS, AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective, population- and registry-based study during 2020. The comparator was the number of patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer during 2017, 2018, and 2019. The outcome was the change in number of newly diagnosed breast cancer cases.
RESULTS: The average monthly percent change after the initial lockdown measures were introduced was -11.0\% (95\% confidence interval - 22.0\% to 1.5\%), resulting in a 24\% reduction of the newly diagnosed breast cancer cases in Croatia during April, May, and June compared with the same period of 2019. However, during 2020, only 1\% fewer new cases were detected than in 2019, or 6\% fewer than what would be expected based on the linear trend during 2017-2019.
CONCLUSION: It seems that national health care system measures for controlling the spread of COVID-19 had a detrimental effect on the number of newly diagnosed breast cancer cases in Croatia during the first lockdown. As it is not plausible to expect an epidemiological change to occur at the same time, this may result in later diagnosis, later initiation of treatment, and less favorable outcomes in the future. However, the effect weakened after the first lockdown and COVID-19 control measures were relaxed, and it has not reoccurred during the second COVID-19 wave. Although the COVID-19 lockdown affected the number of newly diagnosed breast cancers, the oncology health care system has shown resilience and compensated for these effects by the end of 2020.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: It is possible to compensate for the adverse effects of COVID-19 pandemic control measures on breast cancer diagnosis relatively promptly, and it is of crucial importance to do it as soon as possible. Moreover, as shown by this study's results on the number of newly diagnosed breast cancer cases during the second wave of the pandemic, these adverse effects are preventable to a non-negligible extent.},

	abstract = {This article describes a system for short term forecasting based on an ensemble prediction that averages over different combinations of predictors. The system combines a structural time series model for the target series with a regression component capturing the contributions of contemporaneous search query data. A spike-and-slab prior on the regression coefficients induces sparsity, dramatically reducing the size of the regression problem. Our system averages over potential contributions from a very large set of models and gives easily digested reports of which coefficients are likely to be important. We illustrate with applications to initial claims for unemployment benefits and to retail sales. Although our exposition focuses on using search engine data to forecast economic time series, the underlying statistical methods can be applied to more general short term forecasting with large numbers of contemporaneous predictors.},

These models are very flexible and can be identified through its autocorrelation function, which has a very simple form. A na{\"{i}}ve method of parameter estimation is proposed, jointly with the maximum likelihood method based on a revised version of the forward algorithm. The most-probable unobserved time series is reconstructed by means of the Viterbi algorithm.

@article{Morina2020,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 SAGE Publications. It is common in many fields to be interested in the evaluation of the impact of an intervention over a particular phenomenon. In the context of classical time series analysis, a possible choice might be intervention analysis, but there is no analogous methodology developed for low-count time series. In this article, we propose a modified INAR model that allows us to quantify the effect of an intervention, and is also capable of taking into account possible trends or seasonal behaviour. Several examples of application in different real and simulated contexts will also be discussed.},
