abstract = {In this work, we deal with correlated under-reported data through INAR(1)-hidden Markov chain models. These models are very flexible and can be identified through its autocorrelation function, which has a very simple form. A na{\"{i}}ve method of parameter estimation is proposed, jointly with the maximum likelihood method based on a revised version of the forward algorithm. The most-probable unobserved time series is reconstructed by means of the Viterbi algorithm. Several examples of application in the field of public health are discussed illustrating the utility of the models. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

@article{Morina2020,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 SAGE Publications. It is common in many fields to be interested in the evaluation of the impact of an intervention over a particular phenomenon. In the context of classical time series analysis, a possible choice might be intervention analysis, but there is no analogous methodology developed for low-count time series. In this article, we propose a modified INAR model that allows us to quantify the effect of an intervention, and is also capable of taking into account possible trends or seasonal behaviour. Several examples of application in different real and simulated contexts will also be discussed.},
